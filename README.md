# OOTC Succession Dwarf Fort Map
### It's a map! Now you can see it!

**[View *The Systemic Land* here.](https://ciraben.github.io/ootc-fort/)**

This is a lil map-hosting project I thought would complement our group playthrough well – as a way to mark out stuff we notice n care about in the dwarf world at large! I rly like the overworld map part of Dwarf Fortress, as well as the interplay between civilizations outside the fort proper. This let me dwell n explore a bit more than I would've otherwise.

Made for our **[Order of the Cockatrice](https://junethack.net/clan/OrderOfTheCockatrice)** group playthrough of **[DF v50.05](https://kitfoxgames.itch.io/dwarf-fortress)**.
