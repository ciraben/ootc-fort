# OOTC Succession Dwarf Fort Map
### It's a Map! Now you can see it!

This is a lil map-hosting project I thought would complement our group play through well â€“ as a way to mark out stuff we notice n care about in the dwarf world at large! I rly like the overworld map part of Dwarf Fortress, as well as the interplay between civilizations outside the fort proper. This let me dwell n explore a bit more than I would've otherwise.

Made for our **[Order of the Cockatrice](https://junethack.net/clan/OrderOfTheCockatrice)** group playthrough of DF v50.05.
